    | EAGxBoston 22
  summary: Joshua Greene discusses two psychological research projects aimed at broadening
    the scope of human altruism and cooperation. The first (with Lucius Caviola) aims
    to expand the circle of effective giving. They show that ordinary donors are happy
    to give effectively, provided that it is part of a bundled donation including
    a personal favorite charity. They explain the appeal of bundled donations and
    show that economic incentives can boost their appeal. This research led them to

  description: 'Joshua Greene discusses two psychological research projects aimed
    at broadening the scope of human altruism and cooperation. The first (with Lucius
    Caviola) aims to expand the circle of effective giving. They show that ordinary
    donors are happy to give effectively, provided that it is part of a bundled donation
    including a personal favorite charity. They explain the appeal of bundled donations
    and show that economic incentives can boost their appeal. This research led them
    to create GivingMultiplier.org, which incentives bundled donations using a self-sustaining
    system of micro-matching. Since launching in late 2020, Giving Multiplier has
    raised over 1.6 million USD, mostly from donors who are new to effective giving.
    The second project (with Evan Defilippis) aims to reduce political animosity using
    a scalable online quiz game (“RedBrain BlueBrain”). Republicans and Democrats
    play as partners and succeed by reaching mutually rewarding compromises. Two large-scale,
    preregistered experiments showed that an hour of game play can produce warmer
    attitudes toward the political out-group, with effects lasting up to four months.
    These two projects address different problems, but they are grounded in the same
    empirically informed conception of human nature: people are reciprocal cooperators,
    driven by emotions that limit their scope of moral concern. However, people are
    capable of moral expansion through rationally structured opportunities and experiences.View

  summary: Hauke reviews international agreements to spend a percentage of GDP on
    public goods such as aid (0.7%), defence (NATO’s 2% target), R&amp;D, global governance,
    etc. He shows how these agreements interact with priorities in effective altruism
    because they are large in scale, solve (global) public good dilemmas, and relate
    to differential technological development. Finally, he argues that we should advocate
    for a new international agreement to spend 1% of GDP on global risk reduction.

    | Hauke Hillebrandt
  summary: Hauke reviews international agreements to spend a percentage of GDP on
    public goods such as aid (0.7%), defence (NATO’s 2% target), R&amp;D, global governance,
    etc. He shows how these agreements interact with priorities in effective altruism
    because they are large in scale, solve (global) public good dilemmas, and relate
    to differential technological development. Finally, he argues that we should advocate
    for a new international agreement to spend 1% of GDP on global risk reduction.

    EA Survey respondents (2018 and 2019). What makes this organization so special?
    How do they approach their work, and what challenges do they face? Founder and
    CEO Rob Mather answers these questions.Rob Mather is the founder and CEO of The
    Against Malaria Foundation. AMF has now raised more than $190 million, funding
    86 million anti-mosquito bed nets protecting 155 million people in 35 countries,
    mainly in Africa.AMF uses technology, rigorous processes and clear accountability
    to ensure aid is delivered effectively. For seven of the past eight years, AMF
    has been a top-ranked charity of the independent charity evaluators GiveWell and
    The Life You Can Save.Why malaria?Malaria kills about 400,000 people every year
    and more than 200 million fall ill. Before bed nets were made available, it was
    three or more times that. Nets are a proven intervention – a more effective a
    way of saving lives than any other. There is still a long way to go and every
    death from malaria is preventable.70% of the deaths are children under 5Malaria
    is the world’s single largest killer of pregnant women90% of the deaths are in
    sub-Saharan AfricaYet malaria is totally preventable and treatable. Nobody need
    die. Prevention is better than treatment.The most effective means of prevention
    is sleeping under a mosquito netSpecifically a Long-Lasting Insecticide treated
    Net (LLIN)Each net costs $2.00/€1,70/£1.50Every 50-250 nets distributed and installed
    equals 1 life savedGiven the scale of this problem, malaria is clearly a humanitarian
    issue.Malaria is also an economic issue. Malaria is the single greatest drag on
    the economy of Africa. Every $1m spent fighting malaria efficiently improves the
    GDP – the wealth – of the continent of Africa by $12m. Fighting malaria is a very
    good investment.As well as the approximately 400,000 people that die from malaria
    each year, more than 200 million fall sick with malaria. And that means a parent
    has to stay home with a sick child, teachers cannot teach, farmers cannot farm,
    drivers cannot drive, people cannot function. It fundamentally affects people
    working and productivity in Africa.Every $1m we spend fighting malaria efficiently
    we improve the GDP – the wealth – of the continent of Africa by $12m.If we want
    to help Africa out of the situation we all find it in beating malaria is very
    high up, if not top of, the list.This talk was taken from EA Global Asia and Pacific

    she majored in computer science. At Stanford she discovered effective altruism,
    becoming a member of Giving What We Can and pledging to donate 30% of her lifetime
    income to charity, as well as founding a campus advocacy organization. Since 2018,
    Piper has written the Vox column Future Perfect, which covers “the most critical
    issues of the day through the lens of effective altruism”. Piper is concerned
    about global catastrophic risks, and treats journalism as a way to popularize
    these risks and advance the cause of addressing them, which is part of effective
    altruism’s broader concern regarding the relevance of immediate action. Specifically,
    Piper has discussed the possibility that society is living on a historical precipice,
    where immediate action needs to be taken to avoid global catastrophic risks, and
    what implications that has for effective altruism and her own journalism.This

    an organization that was formed to provide information and promote discussion
    and debate about issues in animal ethics, and to provide resources for animal
    advocates and the general public. Their work deals with the way nonhuman animals
    are considered in everyday life, as well as how they are considered in fields
    that affect human attitudes and activities that are relevant to animals. These
    include academia, scientific fields, and the law. Animal Ethics looks at the way
    nonhuman animals are impacted by current human activities, and how they might
    be impacted by future planned or unplanned human activities. This involves not
    only the ways we might harm them, but also how we might help them even when the
    cause of their plight is not human action.This talk was taken from EA Global Asia

    where they could receive life-saving treatment.One of the key barriers to pesticide
    suicide reduction is a lack of human capacity for effective pesticide regulation,
    such as gathering data on the specific HHPs most commonly used for suicide in
    the country, and an absence of mechanisms for surveillance of pesticide poisoning.
    The Centre for Pesticide Suicide Prevention aims to substantially reduce the global
    number of pesticide suicides, by working with national pesticide regulators and
    the UN to identify the hazardous pesticides through research and reduce their
    use through regulation.Source: Effective Altruism Global (video).Effective Altruism

    more effective than setting up cost-effective NGOs, and so should be an EA strategy.
    Based in UC Berkeley, the Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) is a network
    of 70+ academics on the West Coast who devise and test solutions to problems of
    poverty, often working with governments. We’ll present examples from CEGA research

    Claire Walsh, head of J-PAL’s Government Partnership Initiative, will share lessons
    learned about how governments can adopt a more EA approach to policymaking based
    on our partnerships with over 30 national, state, and city governments in over
    15 countries over the past decade. She will feature examples of randomized controlled

    from brain mapping technology and from the neuroscience-AI theoretical interface,
    I will argue that the achievement of accelerated progress in the field is gated
    by support (organizational, cultural, financial) for truly unconventional integrations
    of otherwise disparate ideas and methods. Such approaches sometimes require us
    to deviate from familiar modes of hypothesis-driven science, as we search for
    integrative frameworks and build new kinds of observational tools, but there is
    a chance that they could finally allow us to explore the relevant regions of hypothesis
    space for understanding how the brain works.Source: Effective Altruism Global
